Challenge: 02 - compareTriplets

Difficulty - Easy

Prompt:

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two
challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories:
problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = [a[0], a[1], a[2]], 
and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = [b[0], b[1], b[2]].

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], 
a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

- Write a function called compareTriplets that accepts two arrays and returns
  an array of the respective comparison points of those two arrays.
- The returned array should return in the order of [Alice's points, Bob's points]

Examples:

compareTriplets([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) //=> [1, 1]
compareTriplets([5, 6, 7], [3, 6, 10]) //=> [1, 1]

Challenge: 08 - gradingStudents

Difficulty - Easy

Prompt: 

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

- Write a function named gradingStudents that accepts an array of scores and returns the rounded grades.
- Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range of 1 to 100.
- A score of 40 or lower is a failing grade.
- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
- If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Examples:

A grade of 84 rounds to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
A grade of 29 does not round (result is less than 38)
A grade of 57 does not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Challenge: 09 - kangaroo

Difficulty - Easy

Prompt: 

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos
on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time 
as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

Examples:

kangaroo(0,3,4,2) //=> 'YES'
The two kangaroos jump through the following sequence of locations:
k1 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12)
k2 (4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
It is clear that the kangaroos meet at the same location (number 12 on the number line) 
after same number of jumps (4 jumps), so we print YES.

kangaroo(0,2,5,3) //=> 'NO
The second kangaroo has a starting location that is ahead (further along the number line) 
of the first kangaroo's starting location (i.e., x2 > x1). 
Because the second kangaroo moves at a faster rate (meaning v2 > v1) and is already ahead 
of the first kangaroo, the first kangaroo will never be able to catch up. Thus, we print NO.

Challenge: 11-flatten

Difficulty: Intermediate

Prompt:

- Write a function named flatten that accepts a single array that may 
  contain nested arrays and returns a new "flattened" array.
- A flattened array is an array that contains no nested arrays.
- Arrays may be nested at any level.
- If any of the arrays have duplicate values, those duplicate values 
  should be present in the returned array.
- The values in the new array should maintain their ordering, 
  as shown in the examples below.

Hint:

- This assignment provides an excellent opportunity to use recursion 
  (a function that calls itself). You can also solve it by using an inner function.

Examples:

flatten( [1, [2, 3]] );
//=> [1, 2, 3] (a new array) 

flatten( [1, [2, [3, [4]]], 1, 'a', ['b', 'c']] );

Challenge: 13-isWinningTicket

Difficulty:Intermediate

Prompt:

- Write a function called isWinningTicket that accepts a single array as an argument.
- The input array represents a 'lottery ticket' consisting of one or more nested 2-value arrays. The first value of a nested array will be a string, the second an integer.
- The isWinningTicket function should return true if all of the nested arrays have a character in the string whose numeric character code equals the integer (2nd value).
- If any of the nested arrays have a string where all of the character's character code does not match the integer, then return false.

Hints:

- A character/string can be created from a character code using the String.fromCharCode() class method.
- A character within a string's character code can be obtained using the charCodeAt() string method.

Examples:

isWinningTicket( [ ['ABC', 65] ] ) // => true
isWinningTicket( [ ['ABC', 999], ['XY', 89] ] ) // => false
isWinningTicket( [ ['ABC', 66], ['dddd', 100], ['Hello', 108] ] ) // => true

Challenge: 14-getNumForIP

Difficulty: Intermediate

Prompt:

- Write a function called getNumForIP that accepts a single string as an argument.
- The input string is formatted as an IPv4 address used in networking, such as '192.156.99.15'. To the computer, IP addresses are 32-bit binary numbers. However, people usually find it more convenient to work with these numbers as four sets of 8-bit integers in their decimal form. Each set is separated by a '.' character.
- The getNumForIP function should return the numeric value of the string IP address being passed in as an argument.

Hints:

- Each 8-bit number can hold a value between 0 and 255.
- An IP's right most 8-bit number represents how many of 256 raised to the power of 0 (equals 1) there are. The next 8-bit number represents how many of 256 raised to the power of 1 (256) there are, etc. For example, if you took the right-most two 8-bit numbers of the IP address 192.156.99.15, you would have 15 * (256 ** 0), which equals 15, and 99 * (256**1), which equals 25344.
- To compute the numeric value for an IP address, you first compute the value for each of the four 8-bit chunks (as described in the above hint), and add them together!

Examples:

getNumForIP( '0.0.0.1' ) // => 1
getNumForIP( '0.0.2.0' ) // => 512
getNumForIP( '192.156.99.15' ) // => 3231474447

Challenge: 16-countTheBits

Difficulty: Intermediate

Prompt:

- Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer.
- The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.

Hints:

- We typically work with "decimal" numbers daily. Decimal is "base 10", where there are 10 digits available - 0 thru 9. However, it's binary that computers understand - 1's and 0's. The 1's and 0's are called bits.
- As an example, the decimal value of 13 is represented in binary as 1101. There are 3 one bits and 1 zero bit in the decimal number of 13.
- Carefully read the documentation for the Number.prototype.toString method.

Examples:

countTheBits( 0 ) // => 0
countTheBits( 13 ) // => 3
countTheBits( 256 ) // => 1
countTheBits( 255 ) //=> 8
countTheBits( 65535 ) //=> 16

Challenge: 17-gridTrip

Difficulty: Intermediate

Prompt:

- This challenge uses an imaginary grid where the y coordinate increases when you move up and decreases when you move down. Similarly, the x coordinate increases when you move right and decreases when you move left.
- Write a function called gridTrip that accepts two arguments.
- The first argument is an array containing two integers. The value in the first index of the array represents the starting x position on the grid. The second value in the array represents the starting y position.
- The second argument is a string representing "moves" using the characters 'U', 'D', 'R' & 'L' to mean moving Up, Down, Right & Left, respectively. Each direction character is followed by digits representing how many units to move in that direction. For example, a string of 'D15R2U4' moves down 15 units, right 2 units, and finally, up 4 units from the starting coordinates.
- The direction characters will always be upper case.
- The gridTrip function should return a new array of two integers: the final x position and the final y position. Do not modify the array argument).

Hint:
- Using the String.match method to return an array of regular expression matches can be helpful if you want to break the single string of moves into an array of distinct moves by direction. Be sure to use the global flag, e.g. /cat/g, when defining the regexp.

Examples:

gridTrip( [0, 0], 'U2R1' ) // => [1, 2]
gridTrip( [10, 5], 'D5L15U2' ) //-> [-5, 2]
gridTrip( [100, -22], 'L2L15D50U1D9') //=> [83, -80]

Challenge: 18-addChecker

Difficulty: Intermediate

Prompt:

- Write a function called addChecker that accepts two arguments.
- The first argument is an array containing at least two integers. The integers in the array have been pre-sorted in ascending order.
- The second argument is an integer.
- The addChecker function should return true if there are two integers in the array of integers (first argument) that, when added together, equals the integer passed in as the second argument.
- If there are no two integers in the array with a sum equal to the second argument, addChecker should return false.

Hint:

- An efficient solution can leverage the fact that the integers in the array come sorted for you.

Examples:

addChecker( [1, 2], 3 ) // => true
addChecker( [-3, 2], 9 ) // => false
addChecker( [10, 15, 16, 22], 32 ) // => true

Challenge: 20-totalTaskTime

Difficulty: Difficult

Prompt:

- Write a function called totalTaskTime that accepts two arguments.
- The first argument is an array of integers referred to as a "queue". 
- Each integer in the queue represents a "task" - specifically, the amount of time 
  to complete that task.
- The second argument is an integer representing the number of CPU "threads"
